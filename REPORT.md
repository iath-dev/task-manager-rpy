# Development Process Report

## Overview

This report details the development process, approach, and tools used for the full-stack Task Manager application.

## Development Process

The development process was structured around a full-stack architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between the backend and frontend. The project was initialized as a monorepo to facilitate the management of both the backend and frontend codebases.

The process followed these steps:

1.  **Project Scaffolding:** The initial project structure was created, including the `backend` and `frontend` directories, as well as the necessary configuration files for Docker, Poetry, and npm.
2.  **Backend Development:** The FastAPI backend was developed first, focusing on creating the RESTful API for task and user management. This included setting up the database models, authentication, and API endpoints.
3.  **Frontend Development:** The React frontend was then built to consume the backend API. The focus was on creating a modern, responsive user interface with a clean separation of components and state management.
4.  **Containerization:** Docker was used to containerize both the backend and frontend applications, and Docker Compose was used to orchestrate the services.
5.  **Documentation:** The final step was to create comprehensive documentation for the project, including this report and the `README.md` files.

## Approach

The approach taken was to build a robust and scalable application by using modern, well-established technologies. The key principles were:

*   **Modularity:** The code was organized into modules to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The backend and frontend were developed as separate applications to ensure a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Containerization:** Docker was used to ensure that the application can be easily deployed and run in any environment.
