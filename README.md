# Task Manager Full-Stack Application

This repository contains a full-stack task management application, built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

## Overview

This project is a complete task management solution, designed to be run with Docker. It provides a robust backend API and a modern, user-friendly frontend interface.

*   **Backend:** A powerful RESTful API built with FastAPI, providing endpoints for task and user management.
*   **Frontend:** A responsive and interactive user interface built with React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

The entire application can be easily run using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd task-manager
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. You can copy the `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in the required values.

3.  **Build and run the services:**
